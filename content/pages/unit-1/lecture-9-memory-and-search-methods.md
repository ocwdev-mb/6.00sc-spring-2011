Check Yourself
--------------

What is indirection (in computing)?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

Indirection is the ability to access something using a name or reference instead of the value itself.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

We know that a linear search works on all lists and is O(len(L)). Can we sort a list in sub-linear time?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

No, because we can't sort a list without looking at each element at least once.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

Can we even do it in linear time?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

The answer is probably, no. But we can do it in O(n log n), where n is the length of the list.
