Check Yourself
--------------

How do we use nominal (non-numeric or noncontinuous) categories as features?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

Convert each possible value to a real number.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

Why do we need to use scaling (normalization)?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

To indicate the relative importance of each feature.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

How does k-means clustering work?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

A number 'k' points are chosen, randomly or otherwise, to be the initial centroids; all other points are assigned to their nearest centroid. A new, better centroid is then chosen for each cluster, and we rinse and repeat until the difference between our current set of clusters and the previous set is insignificant.

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 9: Schedule Optimization (Due)

At an institute of higher education that shall remain nameless, it used to be the case that a human adviser would help each student formulate a list of subjects that would meet the student's objectives. However, because of financial troubles, the Institute has decided to replace human advisers with software. Given the amount of work a student wants to do, the program returns a list of subjects that maximizes the amount of value. The goal of this problem set is to implement optimization algorithms.
