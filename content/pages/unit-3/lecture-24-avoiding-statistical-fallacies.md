Check Yourself
--------------

What does GIGO stand for?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

Garbage In Garbage Out: if your data is flawed, any conclusions you draw from it will be, too.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What does 'cum hoc ergo propter hoc' mean?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

It is Latin for "with this, therefore because of this," a logical fallacy which involves incorrectly inferring a causation from a correlation. You should always remember—correlation does not imply causation.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is a lurking variable?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

One which doesn't appear in the plot of two other variables, but could have an effect on both. It is also sometimes referred to as a confounding variable.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 11: Fastest Way to Get Around MIT (Due)

In this problem set you will write a solution to an optimization problem on how to find the shortest route from one building to another on the MIT campus given that you wish to constrain the amount of time you will spend walking outdoors (because generally speaking, the nocturnal beaver… err, um, the nocturnal MIT engineer… hates the sun).

*   {{% resource_link 9543e146-d17b-3be0-86c3-a33675fe1d25 "Code Files (ZIP)" %}} (This ZIP file contains: 1 .txt file and 2 .py files.)

_Note: Solutions are not available for this assignment._
