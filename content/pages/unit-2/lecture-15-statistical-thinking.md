This lecture presents ways of ascertaining how dependable information extracted from samples is likely to be. It covers standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and standard error. It also shows how to use pylab to produce histograms.

--------------

What does the standard deviation tell us?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

It is a distance which describes the range +/- from the mean containing a particular fraction of the values; it describes the shape of the bell curve.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is variance?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

A measure of how much spread there is in the possible different outcomes.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is the coefficient of variation?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

The standard deviation divided by the mean. If it's less than 1, the distribution is considered low-variance.
