Check Yourself
--------------

Can probabilities be added?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

In general, one cannot add probabilities.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is a Monte Carlo simulation?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

A simulation which arrives at an approximation of a probability by running many, many trials.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is the guiding principle of inferential statistics?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

A random sample tends to exhibit the same properties as the population from which it is drawn.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is the law of large numbers (a.k.a. Bernoulli's Law)?

{{< div-with-class "reveal4">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle4">}}

The law of large numbers basically says that using more test cases in a simulation involving randomness will increase our confidence in its results.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is the gambler's fallacy?

{{< div-with-class "reveal5">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle5">}}

The belief that random numbers will even out constantly (e.g. that after a string of heads, it's “time for” the coin to come up tails.)

{{< /div-with-class >}}

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 6: Simulating Robots (Due)

In this problem set you will practice designing a simulation and implementing a program that uses classes.
