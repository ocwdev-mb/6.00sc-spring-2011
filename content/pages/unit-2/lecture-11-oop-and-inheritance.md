In this lecture, we learn about object-oriented programming (OOP) and how classes are used to implement new types of objects in Python. As part of that discussion we introduce inheritance.

What is an instance?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

Instances are the actual objects built in accordance with the qualities of the class.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is an abstract data type?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

A set of objects and the operations on those objects.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is encapsulation?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

Encapsulation means that names (of variables and methods) are stored in locations that then have to be accessed, called namespaces.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is data hiding?

{{< div-with-class "reveal4">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle4">}}

Data hiding makes data invisible to users of the object, requiring it to be accessed only via the object's methods.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What functions can subclasses use?

{{< div-with-class "reveal5">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle5">}}

Subclasses can use all the functions of their superclass. They can also use any functions that are defined within the subclass; however, if the subclass uses the same name for a function which has also been used in the superclass, it will only use the subclass definition of that function.
