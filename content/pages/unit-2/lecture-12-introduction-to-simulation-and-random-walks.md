This lecture completes the introduction of classes by showing a way to implement user-defined iterators. It then discusses simulation models, and illustrates some of the ideas underlying simulations modeling by simulating a random walk.

Check Yourself
--------------

What is a generator?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

A function that remembers the point in the function body where it last returned a value and the values of all local variables.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is the difference between yield and return?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

When yield is used, the state of the function is not lost.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is a model?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

A model is a theoretical construct that will provide useful information about the possible behaviors of the system being modeled.

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 5: RSS Feed Filter (Due)

In problem set 5, you will build a program to monitor news feeds over the Internet. Your program will filter the news, alerting the user when it notices a news story that matches that user's interests (for example, the user may be interested in a notification whenever a story related to the Red Sox is posted).
